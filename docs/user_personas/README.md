# `user_personas` Directory  

## Purpose
This directory contains **user personas** representing key stakeholders for the project. These personas help define the needs, goals, and challenges of different user groups, ensuring a user-centered approach to development. The project software developers can utilize these personas to understand the intent of particular users better. 

## Included Personas:  
1. **End Users** – Individuals who interact with the software in their daily activities.  
2. **Developers** – Team members responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining the software.  
3. **Software Owner** – The person or entity overseeing the software’s development, distribution, and overall vision.
3. **Investor** - The person or organization that provides funding and expects a return on investment.

## Requirements
The feature design must align with the goals and needs of the personas. Each persona should include the following information:
- Name
- Role
- Demographics (age, gender, location, etc.)
- Goals and motivations
- Challenges and pain points
- A brief narrative or scenario illustrating how they interact with the software

These personas provide insights into user expectations and guide feature development, usability improvements, and decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.
