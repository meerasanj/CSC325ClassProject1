# Owner Persona

Note: I thought of the owner persona, in relation to this project proposal, as a kind of portfolio mentor or teacher who is helping students with creating the portfolio.

**Name:** Dr. Tom Carter

**Role:** Computer Science Professor / Project Mentor

**Demographics:** 55 years old, male, San Francisco, CA

**Goals and Motivations:**
- Help students create a professional and effective portfolio to improve their job prospects.
- Provide guidance on best practices in web development and personal branding.
- Ensure the project aligns with industry expectations and standards.

**Challenges and Pain Points:**
- Making sure students balance technical depth with an appealing design.
- Encouraging students to maintain and update their portfolios regularly.
- Ensuring students include content that highlights their skills effectively.

**Scenario:**
Dr. Carter reviews a studentâ€™s portfolio and notices it lacks clear project descriptions. He suggests adding problem statements, solutions, and technologies used to make the portfolio more informative. He also encourages students to include a contact section to make it easier for employers to reach out.
